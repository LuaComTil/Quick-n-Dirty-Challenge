# Quick and Dirty

## The challenge is to make, with a single file, a running server application that provides an interface and database without any frameworks or libraries

### Front-End
HTML and CSS are handled by the PHP file served by the server.
JavaScript handles client-side logic, interactions with the user, and communication with the server.

### Back-End
The PHP file on the server generates and serves HTML and CSS to the client.
It can also handle requests from the client-side with JavaScript and interact with SQLite for data storage.

### Database
SQLite is used for local storage in the clientâ€™s browser.
